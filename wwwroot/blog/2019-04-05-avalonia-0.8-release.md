We are pleased to announce that [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) 0.8 has been
released.

The easiest way to get started with Avalonia is to install our
[Visual Studio plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AvaloniaTeam.AvaloniaforVisualStudio)
and use the templates we provide there or use our 
[.NET core templates](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/avalonia-dotnet-templates). Check out our 
[samples](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/tree/master/samples) for some examples of how 
to get started writing an application.

There have been many bug fixes, performance optimizations and features added. Here is a list of the
biggest new features:

# X11 Backend

Previously on X11 platforms we relied on a locally-installed GTK to handle our windowing. This
caused a number of problems and we used a very small amount of GTK. 
[#2011](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2011) implemented a native X11 backend and
reduced our dependency on GTK's windowing system. File dialogs for now are still reliant on GTK
but the backend is architectured to be able to easily replace the remaining dependencies if the
need arises

# AvaloniaResource

We now have a new resource scheme which allows for more usable URLs for resources. To use
the new resource scheme you should replace `EmbeddedResource` in your `csproj` with `AvaloniaResource`,
for example:

```xml
<AvaloniaResource Include="**\*.xaml">
  <SubType>Designer</SubType>
</AvaloniaResource>
<AvaloniaResource Include="Assets\*"/>
```

In addition, an `x:Class` attribute should be added to your XAML files with the full name of the
associated C# class.

```xml
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             x:Class="MyApplication.MyUserControl">
```

Now you can use relative paths to refer to resources from XAML:

```xml
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        x:Class="MyApplication.MyWindow"
        Icon="/Assets/avalonia-logo.ico">
```

For more information, see our updated project templates:

- [An updated `csproj`](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaVS/blob/master/templates/AvaloniaMvvmApplicationTemplate/ProjectTemplate.csproj)
- [Relative resource paths](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaVS/blob/master/templates/AvaloniaMvvmApplicationTemplate/Views/MainWindow.xaml#L8)

# Dark Theme

[#2078](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2078) added everyone's favorite feature, a dark
theme. Welcome to 2019!

# Refactored Platform Options

[#2368](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2368) refactored our platform options API to make
supplying options for each platform much simpler. An example from before:

```csharp
public static AppBuilder BuildAvaloniaApp()
{
    var builder = AppBuilder.Configure<App>();
    if(RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Linux))
         builder.UseX11(new X11PlatformOptions() {UseGpu = false});
    else if(RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.OSX))
         builder.UseAvaloniaNative(anopts => 
         {
              anopts.UseGpu = false;
              anopts.MacOptions.ShowInDock = 0;
         });
    else if(RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows))
          builder.UseWin32(false, true);
    return builder;
}
```

With the new API becomes much more readable:

```
public static AppBuilder BuildAvaloniaApp() => AppBuilder.Configure<App>()
     .UsePlatformDetect()
     .With(new X11PlatformOptions { UseGpu = false })
     .With(new AvaloniaNativePlatformOptions { UseGpu = false })
     .With(new MacOSPlatformOptions { ShowInDock = false })
     .With(new Win32PlatformOptions { UseDeferredRendering = false });
```

# New designer

Our Visual Studio designer has been rewritten from the ground up with a new previewer engine. You
should find the designer more stable and less prone to hangs. A few features are still missing but
these will be added back in going forward.

# ViewBox

[#2066](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2066) added a much-requested control from WPF
and UWP: the `ViewBox`.

# DropDown renamed to ComboBox

As part of our attempt to reduce the friction experienced when moving from other frameworks to
Avalonia, we decided to rename our `DropDown` control to `ComboBox`
([#2393](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2393))

We still have a DropDown control that is marked as [Obsolete] to aid migration, but this will be
removed in a future release.

# DataGrid

The `DataGrid` control has now moved to `Avalonia.Controls.DataGrid`. To use the `DataGrid` in your
application you must add a call to `UseDataGrid` to your AppBuilder:

```csharp
public static AppBuilder BuildAvaloniaApp()
     => AppBuilder.Configure<App>()
          .UsePlatformDetect()
          .UseDataGrid();
```

And add the `DataGrid`'s default theme to your `App.xaml`:

```xml
<Application.Styles>
     <StyleInclude Source="avares://Avalonia.Themes.Default/DefaultTheme.xaml"/>
     <StyleInclude Source="avares://Avalonia.Themes.Default/Accents/BaseLight.xaml"/>
     <StyleInclude Source="resm:Avalonia.Controls.DataGrid.Themes.Default.xaml?assembly=Avalonia.Controls.DataGrid"/>
</Application.Styles>
```

# Multiple Selection in TreeView

[#2347](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2347) introduced support for multiple selection
in the TreeView control.

# More ReactiveUI support

[#2294](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2294) introduced support for ReactiveUI's
`RoutedViewHost` control.

# System Font API

[#2227](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/2227) added an API to enumerate the system fonts
on the running system.
